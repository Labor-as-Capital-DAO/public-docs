## Introduction

<a id="Intro">[Intro]</a>

*Purple Book* contains provisions, instructions, rules, conditions, a log of important events, voting records with results, plans, and clarifications. It serves as a charter, founding agreement, and the logbook of the "ship named Labor as Capital in the ocean of the internet" — all in one file.

***Any adult with basic skills in using a computer, smartphone, and the internet can participate in Labor as Capital DAO. No special knowledge in crypto, DeFi, or Web3 is required, as detailed instructions will be provided through the Official Information Channels of Labor as Capital DAO [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh), and additional guidance can always be requested in the official community chats [[OfInfoCh-chats]](#OfInfoCh-chats) of LaC.***

The Purple Book is dynamic; it evolves in accordance with proposals from LaC DAO Token holders, and updates are made to dates/names as events occur. Information awaiting clarification is enclosed in curly brackets with an explanation, for example: *{to be determined after voting}*.

***Labor as Capital DAO operates in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC / GMT +0) and ensures that your expectations in line with your purpose are met.***

Follow the activities of Labor as Capital DAO on GitHub and subscribe to changes in its repositories to receive notifications about updates to the original Purple Book and other documents of Labor as Capital DAO.

Before reviewing the Purple Book, it is recommended to carefully study the White Paper of Labor as Capital DAO:  [https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/WhitePaper.md](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/WhitePaper.md)

The White Paper provides the rationale behind the plans and actions described in the Purple Book and other documents. The original Purple Book also includes always-updated links to secondary information resources of LaC DAO and community chats in different languages.

## Abbreviations and Definitions

<a id="Defs">[Defs]</a>

<a id="LaC">[LaC]</a> **LaC** : Labor as Capital: International Accelerator of Systems for Outcall Services, Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

<a id="iol">[iol]</a> **iol** : The Internet of Labour ecosystem/platform. Video explanation of how iol works: [https://youtu.be/MpCn5Wa9SyE](https://youtu.be/MpCn5Wa9SyE). Open resources of iol: [https://github.com/internet-of-labour](https://github.com/internet-of-labour).

<a id="DDN">[DDN]</a> **DDN**. Distributed Digital Nomads, a community of highly skilled freelance IT specialists from different countries. DDN specializes in creating iol-apps and closely collaborates with the authors of iol. Some iol [[iol]](#iol) authors may be members of DDN. Open resources of iol-providers from DDN: [https://github.com/Distributed-Digital-Nomads](https://github.com/Distributed-Digital-Nomads).

**TM** : Technical management [[TM]](#TM) of LaC.

**MM** : Media management [[MM]](#MM) of LaC.

**FM** : Financial management [[FM]](FM) of LaC.

**DeFi** : Decentralized Finance, [https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance).

**Token** ***{name to be chosen later}*** : A token on the blockchain network *{network to be chosen later}* for the governance of LaC as a DAO-type company. Until the name of the token and the blockchain network are chosen, it will be temporarily called **LaC Token**. The LaC Token is a projected decentralized financial instrument, whose value is directly proportional to the number of users of iol-businesses in the Labor as Capital DAO portfolio, and is not tied to the profit of those iol-businesses. ***Before the official issuance, the LaC Token cannot appear on any exchanges or trading platforms***: carefully study the White Paper and Purple Book, follow their updates and official news, ***beware of fakes and report them in the official information channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh) of LaC!***

<a id="ResWallet">[ResWallet]</a> **Reserve wallet** : a special multisig wallet with LaC Tokens. After the release of the LaC Token, they are distributed across several reserve wallets, each with a specific purpose for LaC and unique signers. The distribution procedure is described in the document [[Instr-TokenAssign]](#Instr-TokenAssign).

<a id="pool">[pool]</a> **iol Pool** : an internal accounting system for user funds in iol storage. The currency pool uses bank accounts, provided by licensed Financial Service Providers (FSP) of iol and owned by iol resources, to store fiat currencies. The crypto pool uses iol crypto accounts on blockchain networks. NiXeL does not provide financial services and is not a payment system. The Pool can be compared to exchange accounts, but only for labor-related needs of the iol ecosystem and its users. Therefore, transactions within the iol Pool are free of charge. The iol Pool is used to guarantee payment for services in iol-apps, calculate commissions, exchange crypto assets without fees as an L2 solution, protect funds by separating transactions from external systems, and is ***not intended for use as a personal bank account***. It has enhanced multi-level control for fund withdrawal to personal bank accounts or blockchain wallets, with balance history verification similar to blockchain links. Each iol user has their own pool balance in the ecosystem.

**iol-provider** : a team of one or more authors who have created a functional iol-app. An iol-provider can be a company and establish an iol-business.

**iol-app** : a software application running within the iol ecosystem using iol features.

**iol-business** : an organization or sole-trader representing an iol-app in a specific region in compliance with regional laws and responsibilities.

**Portfolio LaC** : a list of iol-businesses that have received funding from LaC for development. The list is maintained in the file: [https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md). Detailed information about iol-businesses in the LaC portfolio is stored in the application.md files within their directories in the repository: [https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/Portfolio](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/Portfolio).

<a id="BoF">[BoF]</a> **BoF** : Board of Frontmen of Labor as Capital DAO. A group of LaC Token holders with special rights and access to LaC’s informational resources.

<a id="sinhro">[sinhro]</a> **SINHRO** : an internal mechanism of the Internet of Labour (iol) platform/ecosystem for synchronizing with tools of classical economics and finance. Initially, SINHRO was adopted by iol developers as an internal tool for compensating labor related to iol development. Later, its function was expanded to include compensation of commissions paid by users of iol-apps after outcall services are delivered. This balances their expenses and can serve as an additional income source during periods of disability or retirement. Thus, SINHRO is issued only for actual labor performed and is involved in commission distribution in iol-apps immediately after the commission is paid. This is clearly demonstrated in a video of one of the market-available iol-apps for iol-businesses: [https://youtube.com/watch?v=MyM4rEIdxKc&list=PLjwIP64KxSmooIR7k1myxDd-3_4rKSp6a&index=6](https://youtube.com/watch?v=MyM4rEIdxKc&list=PLjwIP64KxSmooIR7k1myxDd-3_4rKSp6a&index=6) — see the part about final service payment. Free exchange between SINHRO and LaC Token [[RMap-TDex]](#RMap-TDex) links the crypto world and iol. ***SINHRO is backed up in blockchain networks under another name: beware of fakes*** and report them in LaC’s official information channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh).

<a id="LaC-iol-sync">[LaC-iol-sync]</a> **LaC-iol synchronization** : The time period from the publication of the Purple Book of LaC to the release of the LaC Token and its distribution to all participants of this period — the decentralization period. During this time, all LaC resources are calibrated, instructions improved, intellectual leaders [[IntelRes]](#IntelRes) of LaC identified, initial members of BoF [[BoF]](#BoF) formed, and practical onboarding to the NiXeL [[nxl]](#nxl) dApp takes place. For calibration, SINHRO [[sinhro]](#sinhro) is used as a special transport in the pre-release distribution of rights to the LaC Token. Practically, LaC-iol synchronization is the founding phase of Labor as Capital DAO as the Internet of Labour representative using LaC intellectual resources, i.e., everyone who receives the LaC Token during this time is a founder of the IASOS Labor as Capital DAO. During LaC-iol synchronization, LaC is not yet a full DAO, so the moderator of this process is the LaC White Paper author Alik Xandro, under the supervision of the intellectual resource and with control from iol authors.

<a id="infop">[infop]</a> **Information partner** : the owner of a mass media or public relations [[pr]](#pr) resource, or a person who has the ability to publish their material on media platforms. Based on performance, the partner’s informational resource may be added to the official information channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh) of LaC through a vote [[Instr-TVote]](#Instr-TVote).

<a id="ulim">[ulim</a>] **ULIM** : A unique link/url of an informational material generated for each media content by LaC’s Media Management. ULIM is used to automatically account for the results of a publication.

<a id="r2im">[r2im]</a> **Reaction to informational material** : user actions on informational platforms like social networks, video platforms, messengers, forums, and user groups, in response to content published there. These actions include: like/dislike, comment, share, rating, etc.

&nbsp;  

## Technical Resources

<a id="TechRes">[TechRes]</a>

**Web3**. LaC has special access to the distributed resources of iol [[iol]](#iol) to carry out its DeFi activities and to request statistical data related to the state of the outcall services sector.

**Blockchain**. LaC uses a blockchain network *{to be chosen later [[Instr-TokenAssign]](#Instr-TokenAssign)}*.

**Git**. LaC uses GitHub, which may be replaced if it no longer satisfies the LaC Token holders.

**Messengers**. LaC uses third-party chats and conference tools for public and private discussions.

<a id="pr">[pr]</a> **Mass media and Public Relations**. LaC uses media resources and platforms managed by its information partners [[infop]](#infop), its own news channels and chats [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh), as well as information channels of iol and DDN [[DDN]](#DDN). Under certain conditions for iol-businesses in the LaC portfolio, duplication of official announcements and news from LaC in the information channels of those iol-businesses may be required.

<a id="nxl">[nxl]</a> **NiXeL**. A special iol-app, an Android application with access to dedicated iol Web3 APIs. Available in Google Play: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=space.diamo.iol.nixel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=space.diamo.iol.nixel)

&nbsp;  

## Intellectual Resources

<a id="IntelRes">[IntelRes]</a>

The Internet of Labour ecosystem/platform has absorbed an enormous amount of intellectual resources and professional experience. Labor as Capital DAO [[LaC]](#LaC), as the holder of exclusive access to iol [[iol]](#iol), inherits this resource. As LaC achieves its goals and expands its portfolio, it multiplies this legacy of resources.

&nbsp; 

 &emsp; <a id="TM">[TM]</a> **Technical Management:**

DDN [[DDN]](#DDN) are holders of the LaC Token and are ready to execute technical tasks on behalf of LaC, including making changes and additions to iol. DDN track updates in the Purple Book and align their technical components accordingly. All initiated and completed tasks are logged in the file: [https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/TM-Exec.md](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/TM-Exec.md). DDN may also provide technical support to iol-providers whose iol-businesses aim to be included in the LaC portfolio.

Any individual may propose a technical solution that contributes to LaC's goals via the official community chats. The discussion may continue in the private chats of the Board of Frontmen in cooperation with representatives of Media Management [[MM]](#MM). If the solution is accepted by the iol authors and/or DDN, they may invite the individual to their circle and offer implementation of the proposed technical solution into LaC governance.

Admins of official information channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh) and iol authors are also part of TM.

TM has its own Reserve Wallet [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet) with a significant amount of LaC Tokens allocated for technical resources and their development.

&nbsp; 

 &emsp; <a id="MM">[MM]</a> **Media Management:**

This includes Information Partners [[infop]](#infop) and anyone who disseminates information about LaC’s activities in Media and Public Relations [[pr]](#pr) platforms, in a way that supports LaC’s goals and does not contradict its official documents. MM materials include all other types of public communication about LaC: posts, articles, blogs, podcasts, short videos, presentations, public speeches, exhibitions, advertisements, books, etc.

MM receives a significant share of LaC Tokens at the start and controls their distribution for the continued development of MM through a separate Reserve Wallet [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet) designated for MM. Before the Token is issued, MM participants are onboarded during the MM initialization process [[RMap-MMInit]](#RMap-MMInit), where key contributors are selected to be signers of the MM Reserve Wallet. Active MM participants may become members of BoF [[BoF]](#BoF).

Moderators of official information channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh) are also part of MM.

&nbsp;  

&emsp; <a id="FM">[FM]</a> **Financial Management:**

Since LaC is a DeFi entity, any LaC Token holder may use their tokens at their own discretion, including exchanging them for fiat or vice versa. The signers of Reserve Wallets [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet) participate in LaC's financial management by exercising their right to sign Reserve Wallet transactions.

Any currency involved in LaC activities, including for purchasing or selling LaC Tokens, is considered LaC’s Currency Resource [[CurrRes]](#CurrRes). Therefore, anyone who buys or sells LaC Tokens for currency is participating in FM. This is the most cost-effective method to acquire LaC Tokens with participation in the initial pricing determination in relation to USD, Bitcoin, and SINHRO [[sinhro]](#sinhro).

There are ***special conditions*** [[CurrRes-spec]](#CurrRes-spec) for those who wish to acquire LaC Tokens using currency before the token is officially issued and distributed — that is, during the LaC-iol synchronization period [[LaC-iol-sync]](#LaC-iol-sync). These conditions are described in detail in the Currency Resource [[CurrRes]](#CurrRes) section.

Currency Resources received during this period are used to accelerate the LaC-iol synchronization process:

(i) payment for third-party subscription-based technical tools such as GitHub, CoinMarketCap, GPT (AI), and cloud services;

(ii) advertisement platforms;

(iii) traffic generation to LaC's official information channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh);

(iv) payment for multimedia materials (graphics, video, audio, promo content);

(v) hardware and security.

The volume and use of incoming Currency Resources during the LaC-iol synchronization period may be requested by those who participated under the special conditions and contributed the equivalent of $50K or more. Any unused funds from this period will be used to acquire the first iol-business into the LaC portfolio by purchasing the LaC Tokens allocated to that business.

FM has its own Reserve Wallet [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet) with a significant amount of LaC Tokens designated for expenses related to traditional finance.

&nbsp;  

## Currency Resources

<a id="CurrRes">[CurrRes]</a>

Currency resources include fiat currencies of all countries and the top 20 liquid cryptocurrencies by daily trading volume on major crypto exchanges. Anyone using a currency resource in relation to the LaC Token is directly participating in Financial Management [[FM]](#FM), which is a ***real implementation of DeFi***. In the same way, through the LaC Token, iol-businesses can receive this resource when needed for the objectives stated in their application to the Labor as Capital DAO [[LaC]](#LaC) portfolio.

&nbsp;  

### Special conditions

 &emsp; <a id="CurrRes-spec">[CurrRes-spec]</a>

The right to the LaC Token can be acquired using currency resources [[CurrRes]](#CurrRes) before the official release of the LaC Token. This is the lowest-cost and fastest method of acquiring the LaC Token, with the following benefits:

(!) Special consideration is given to the opinion of blockchain network developers when selecting the blockchain network [[Instr-TokenAssign]](#Instr-TokenAssign) for the LaC Token.

(i) 25% annual return for use of funds prior to token issuance and distribution. Currency used before issuance is considered already-earned private property of the contributor and must be compensated. Such participants receive a larger token allocation when calculating the initial price of the LaC Token [[Instr-TInitPrice]](#Instr-TInitPrice), based on 25% annual interest from the date of currency transfer until token distribution.

(ii) Inclusion in the selection pool of blockchain addresses for signing Reserve Wallets [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet) at the time of LaC Token distribution [[Instr-TokenAssign]](#Instr-TokenAssign).

(iii) Right to request information on volume and use of currency resources received during the LaC-iol synchronization period [[LaC-iol-sync]](#LaC-iol-sync) after that period.

(iv) SINHRO is used as an interim transport before the LaC Token release, so you immediately receive SINHRO on your balance in the NiXeL wallet according to [[Instr-PreTokenCurr]](#Instr-PreTokenCurr). This can serve as protection against unforeseen risks in LaC development. In addition to converting it into the LaC Token later, you may use SINHRO immediately — it can be exchanged for fiat in NiXeL, used in iol smart ivoice, or for receiving a share of commissions in iol apps. You may choose not to exchange your SINHRO for LaC Tokens at the initial price stage [[RMap-TInitPrice]](#RMap-TInitPrice), or convert only a part. SINHRO synchronizes — you govern.

Instructions for advance reservation of LaC Token using currency resources are available in [[Instr-PreTokenCurr]](#Instr-PreTokenCurr).

&nbsp;  

## Roadmap

<a id="RMap">[RMap]</a>

The Road Map outlines the core procedures from the publication of the Purple Book of Labor as Capital DAO [[LaC]](#LaC) through to the first exchange of the LaC Token and the acquisition of the first iol-business into the LaC portfolio — this period is referred to as LaC-iol synchronization [[LaC-iol-sync]](#LaC-iol-sync) + first iol-business in the LaC portfolio.

During this period:

- Active governance participants of LaC are onboarded,

- They are included as signatories of the respective Reserve Wallets [[ResWallet]](ResWallet),

- The initial members of the Board of Frontmen [[BoF]](#BoF) are identified and included.

Following this phase, the procedures are repeated in cycles — continuously improving technical resources and acquiring additional iol-businesses into the Labor as Capital DAO portfolio. This cyclical progression ensures a stable increase in the value of the LaC Token, in accordance with the valuation formula defined in the White Paper of IASOS LaC DAO.

A timeline chart of the Road Map is shown schematically below.

![Road Map](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/imgs/chart_RMap.png?raw=true)

The detailed procedural descriptions follow. 

&nbsp;  

### Initialization of Media Management

 &emsp; <a id="RMap-MMInit">[RMap-MMInit]</a>

**Period**: *{from the moment of the Purple Book publication until the onboarding of the first 3 media partners into the BoF}*.  
**Involved resources**: MM [[MM]](#MM), TM [[TM]](#TM).  
**Description**: Attracting media partners to cover LaC’s activities. This period continues until the following goals are achieved:

(i) at least 1 million unique views of the White Paper of IASOS LaC DAO;

(ii) at least 1 permanent media partner with an audience of no less than 500,000 subscribers'

(iii) at least 3 media partners in the BoF [[BoF]](#BoF).

The formation of Technical Management [[TM]](#TM) took place during the period when the authors of iol and DDN [[DDN]](#DDN) made the decision to be represented by the Labor as Capital organization for the iol ecosystem [[iol]](#iol), which took 4 months and was the most decisive process in the creation of LaC DAO. The MM initialization period is the most critical process, during which the first public faces of LaC are effectively formed, with corresponding significant token shares and privileges. Also, ***this period is the best opportunity to obtain the LaC Token for social media users through posts, articles, reposts, translations of MM [[MM]](#MM) materials into other languages, and similar activities — a kind of AirDrop***.

The procedure and conditions for joining MM are described in [[Instr-MM]](#Instr-MM).

The procedure and conditions for BoF members are in [[Instr-BoF]](#Instr-BoF).

&nbsp;  

### LaC Token Issuance and Distribution

 &emsp; <a id="RMap-TIssue">[RMap-TIssue]</a>

**Period**: *{2 weeks after the MM initialization}*.  
**Involved resources**: TM [[TM]](#TM).  
**Description**: By this time, active participants of LaC's intellectual resource have been identified, both in TM and MM [[MM]](#MM), whose addresses will be included as signers of the corresponding Reserve Wallets [[RezWallet]](#RezWallet). Now the LaC Token can be issued and distributed to the Reserve Wallets according to the rules in [[Instr-TokenAssign]](#Instr-TokenAssign). This kind of distribution removes sole control of LaC Tokens from the TM specialist involved in the token issuance.

&nbsp;  

### Listing LaC Token on DEX via NiXeL

 &emsp; <a id="RMap-TDex">[RMap-TDex]</a>

**Period**: *{~2 weeks after token distribution to reserve wallets}*.  
**Involved resources**: TM [[TM]](#TM).  
**Description**: NiXeL [[nxl]](#nxl) already has SINHRO [[sinhro]](#sinhro) exchange to various currencies implemented, demo video [https://youtu.be/wp6TUPTZb_E](https://youtu.be/wp6TUPTZb_E). During this period, developers from TM add similar functionality for the LaC Token using the iol Pool [[pool]](#pool), release an instruction and a demo video of the LaC Token DEX, and publish this news in LaC's official information channels [[OfInfoCh]](OfInfoCh). Thus, the LaC Token becomes immediately convertible to currencies and SINHRO through the free already market-accessible Android app named NiXeL.

SINHRO to LaC Token convertibility enables TM and iol [[iol]](#iol) authors who receive SINHRO for their work to obtain LaC Tokens.

Changes and improvements to the DEX in NiXeL can be proposed by any user through the usual process. Since the LaC Token is on blockchain, further listings on other existing DEXes and crypto exchanges may be carried out independently of LaC's TM.

&nbsp;  

### Initial Price Determination for LaC Token and distribution to LaC-iol Synchronization participants

 &emsp; <a id="RMap-TInitPrice">[RMap-TInitPrice]</a>

**Period**: *{~3 weeks after [[RMap-TDex]](#RMap-TDex)}*.  
**Involved resources**: Entire intellectual resource [[IntelRes]](#IntelRes).  
**Description**: Initially, before the MM [[MM]](#MM) initialization, SINHRO was held only by iol [[iol]](#iol) authors (issued solely for their labor) and those who managed to exchange currency for SINHRO from the authors in NiXeL. Some of these SINHRO were transferred to LaC-iol synchronization participants as described in the instructions, including those who participated with currency resources. Now all SINHRO holders can submit requests in NiXeL to exchange SINHRO for LaC Tokens, specifying desired amount and rate. These requests will be processed according to [[Instr-TInitPrice]](#Instr-TInitPrice) from the appropriate Reserve Wallets [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet), determining the initial rate of the LaC Token based on the preferences of LaC-iol synchronization participants — i.e., the founders of Labor as Capital DAO.

This method of determining the initial price of the LaC Token is optimal because anyone who wants to acquire LaC Tokens at this time faces a dilemma: on one hand, they are not interested in a low LaC Token price; on the other hand, they don’t want to lose too much SINHRO, which generates income from iol-app commissions. On a third side, a lower valuation of LaC Token relative to SINHRO increases SINHRO's value, meaning its exchange rate may surge.

The SINHRO exchange rate is hard to suppress because:

(i) it is earned only through real labor and only in iol;

(ii) it is scarce — most SINHRO was issued during intense iol development when features were approved in production releases;

(iii) users prefer commission shares over selling SINHRO;

(iv) it is not traded on exchanges, i.e., it's not a speculative asset, and for external exchange, it can only be converted to LaC Token via the DEX in NiXeL.

***This marks the end of the LaC-iol synchronization: all founders have received their LaC Tokens — the International Accelerator of Systems for Outcall Services "Labor as Capital" DAO is now fully established***.

The initial LaC Token rate relative to fiat currencies can also be determined: iol supports over 50 national currencies, which are selectable for LaC Token exchange in NiXeL along with SINHRO. The initial rate relative to Bitcoin can be calculated via cross-rate, e.g., through USD. However, TM [[TM]](#TM) plans to add several popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, after implementing the iol Pool [[pool]](#pool) for the LaC Token, ensuring it's actually needed by most LaC Token holders.

&nbsp;  

### Onboarding the First iol-Business to LaC Portfolio

 &emsp; <a id="RMap-PortfFirst">[RMap-PortfFirst]</a>

**Period**: *{begins immediately after [RMap-TInitPrice] and continues until inclusion into the portfolio}*.  
**Involved resources**: Entire intellectual resource [[IntelRes]](#IntelRes).  
**Description**: During this period, the practical implementation of MM [[MM]](#MM) activities takes place, including the responsiveness of TM [[TM]](#TM) in tasks such as voting feature implementation within LaC’s technical resources [[TechRes]](#TechRes), refinement of the Purple Book by LaC Token holders, and interaction between LaC and iol-businesses and their providers. To accomplish this, the intellectual resource does the following:

(i) MM, especially information partners and BoF [[BoF]](#BoF) members, inform the global community about LaC as the International Accelerator of Systems for Outcall Services. iol-providers who want their *iol-app*-based businesses to receive development funding do the same through their own information channels. The goal is to draw entrepreneurs’ attention to the capabilities of IASOS Labor as Capital DAO’s technical and DeFi resources, particularly the [[Instr-BizAppy]](#Instr-BizAppy) instruction.

(ii) TM prepares a solution and instruction/demo for LaC Token holders to vote [[Instr-Tvote]](#Instr-Tvote) without token burning. The voting mechanism is improved progressively based on proposals from token holders.

(iii) FM executes transactions using [[Instr-BizInvest]](#Instr-BizInvest), necessary for completing the inclusion of an iol-business into LaC’s portfolio in the event of a positive vote.

(iv) After the iol-business receives funds, TM adds the display of statistical data on iol-businesses required for evaluating the LaC Token based on business performance.

(v) MM informs the global public about the acquisition of a new iol-business in the Labor as Capital DAO portfolio.

The entire process—from the iol-business application to the transactions through which iol-businesses receive LaC Tokens — is open and real-time.

This decentralized management experience will continue to be used by the intellectual resources of MM, TM, FM and via the participation of all willing LaC Token holders in voting, throughout LaC’s operation, ensuring progress toward the core and ongoing goal of Labor as Capital DAO as stated in its White Paper: ***the steady growth of the token’s value***.

&nbsp;  

## Security and Responsibility

<a id="Sec">[Sec]</a>

The choice of organizing the representative of the Internet of Labour [[iol]](#iol) ecosystem/platform as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) was primarily driven by security considerations for the owners of Labor as Capital [[LaC]](#LaC) (i.e., LaC Token holders) during times of global economic, demographic, and geopolitical crises. The mission of iol is intended to alleviate issues related to these crises, particularly regarding employment and direct access to labor producers and private services with guaranteed payment.

DAO governance via a blockchain-based governance token allows LaC Token holders to remain anonymous. However, LaC Token holders who wish to be members of the Board of Frontmen [[BoF]](#BoF) must be verified in accordance with [[Instr-BoF]](#Instr-BoF). These are individuals fully confident in the righteousness of the LaC/iol mission and filled with gratitude to the Almighty for the opportunity to co-create. At the same time, in organizations such as DAOs, no holder of the DAO governance token, including BoF members, bears responsibility for the DAO’s activity by the very definition of a DAO, just as the DAO bears no responsibility for its token holders. Owners of technical resources such as software products, blockchain nodes, social networks, messengers, platforms, app stores, marketplaces, financial service providers, iol providers, iol apps, and iol businesses used by LaC also bear no responsibility for LaC’s activities or its token holders. LaC bears no responsibility for technical resources, and vice versa.

It is impossible to list all recommendations for protecting your tokens and crypto assets on blockchain networks; this knowledge must be acquired through crypto-dedicated internet resources. Nonetheless, the "Governing principles for security" [[Sec-g4s]](#Sec-g4s) section provides key points from the perspective of LaC participants.

Each LaC Token holder is likely interested not only in the security of their own tokens but also in the overall safety of LaC and its resources. Such LaC co-owners may share the mission of iol and contribute to the security of LaC’s technical and intellectual resources independently, and possibly without being known to others, using their own methods. The addresses of such holders will be included in the signatures of Reserve Wallets [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet) related to security.

Security also involves certain Reserve Wallets participating in the LaC Token distribution [[Instr-TokenAssign]](#Instr-TokenAssign) immediately after issuance, playing a vital role both in LaC’s operations and in insuring the LaC Tokens against various external negative events, including technical and human factors. These may include intentional harmful actions by commercial companies against the non-commercial iol platform as a resource of Labor as Capital DAO. The authors of iol advocate for fair competition, and competitive opportunities for iol providers are embedded into the iol architecture, making the Internet of Labour ecosystem a platform.

After successful completion of all creation and launch processes [[RMap]](#RMap) for IASOS Labor as Capital DAO, the iol account with the username **alikx** will be blocked. This special account was created solely for the purpose of organizing LaC and serving the initial LaC participants until full decentralization was achieved, with multiple moderators of different user support levels having access to it. To prevent further personal contact with LaC Token holders through this account and for security purposes, the account will be blocked using NiXeL’s terms of use. Future reactivation of the **alikx** account, if necessary, will be possible via voting within LaC.

&nbsp;  

## Instructions and Regulations

<a id="Instr">[Instr]</a>

This section contains rules, restrictions, instructions, and is continuously improved as Labor as Capital DAO [[LaC]](#LaC) evolves.

Violations of restrictions and attempts at sabotage may be perceived by moderators of information channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh), administrators of technical resources [[TechRes]](#TechRes), and other LaC Token holders as actions opposing the goals of LaC, a breach of the terms of resource usage, and a threat to LaC's security. This may result in inconveniences for the violator when using certain features of LaC.

&nbsp;  

### Basic Rules

 &emsp; <a id="Instr-Base">[Instr-Base]</a>

(i) The mission of LaC does not allow discrimination of any kind, including gender, racial, national, ethnic, religious, political, linguistic, anatomical, etc: ***LaC DAO token is an elite crypto asset***. For the purpose of organizing LaC’s governance, people are only distinguished as combinations of "LaC Token Holder", "Board of Frontmen Member [[BoF]](#BoF)", "Rule Violator of LaC", "Not Loyal to LaC Activity", and their affiliation with types of intellectual resources [[IntelRes]](#IntelRes).

(ii) Negative information about Labor as Capital DAO’s activities is prohibited. To address shortcomings, contradictions, or errors in LaC’s operations, such issues must be reported via official information channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh).

(iii) Do not violate copyright and related rights of LaC’s technical and intellectual resources. Comply with the licenses of the Labor as Capital DAO repositories (for example, the license of the public documents repository on GitHub: [https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/LICENSE](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/LICENSE)) and monitor for updates.

(iv) Monitor changes in public documents and messages in official information channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh) independently.

(v) Use of Labor as Capital DAO features that violate your country’s laws is not recommended. Handle LaC Tokens responsibly.

(vi) Often, for selecting a limited number of participants in instructions, the intellectual resource and LaC activities use a list of entries in the file [https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/footprint.txt](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/footprint.txt). It is recommended to add a new line with any short welcoming text to the end of this file once. This may be used, for example, to identify those who learned about Labor as Capital DAO early based on the edit history of this file. Therefore, add your line to this file right now to permanently establish an early timestamp in case you join LaC later. To edit files on GitHub, you can follow the instruction: [https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/.github/blob/main/editIstruct.md](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/.github/blob/main/editIstruct.md).

(vii) Do not propose changes to documents out of destructive or harmful intent.

(viii) Violations of rules and instructions may lead to loss of privileges and access to technical resources, and in some cases be considered a security threat.

&nbsp;  

### How to Use the NiXeL App

(ii) Alik Xandro will request the required amount of SINHRO for you from TM in a private chat, where the purpose of your currency and the method of exchange will be determined depending on the currency resource. In some cases, a direct transfer to a TM member may be possible.

(iii) Alik Xandro will reply to you in the chat with instructions depending on your currency and in your preferred or English language. You may ask each other clarifying questions regarding reserving the LaC Token for a currency resource.

(iv) At the end of the process, you will receive an amount of SINHRO in your balance via smart invoice corresponding to the current SINHRO exchange rate.

(v) After the LaC Token is issued, you can exchange SINHRO for LaC Token according to [[RMap-TInitPrice]](#RMap-TInitPrice).

Acquiring SINHRO for reserving LaC Token through a chat with Alik Xandro allows the use of special conditions [[CurrRes-spec]](#CurrRes-spec).

&nbsp;  

### Joining Media Management

 &emsp; <a id="Instr-MM">[Instr-MM]</a>

This instruction applies during the LaC-iol synchronization period [[LaC-iol-sync]](#LaC-iol-sync) and essentially represents the initial mining of LaC Tokens through informational labor. After this period, the instruction will be modified by those who were involved in this phase within MM [[MM]](#MM) and who are signers of the Resource Wallet [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet) of MM. The LaC-iol synchronization is the easiest way to obtain more LaC Tokens by following these instructions, as you are the ones defining the initial price of the LaC Token [[RMap-TInitPrice]](#RMap-TInitPrice) after its release.

&nbsp;  

 &emsp; **For informational partners** [[infop]](#infop):

Informational partners must be able to read and write in English fluently. GPT or translation tools may be used for this.

### LaC Token Allocation to Reserve Wallets

 &emsp; <a id="Instr-TokenAssign">[Instr-TokenAssign]</a>

Pie Allocation Scheme of the LaC Token to Reserve Wallets [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet):

![Token Allocation](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/imgs/chart_ResWallets.png?raw=true)

&nbsp;  

 &emsp; **Blockchain Network and LaC Token Naming Selection:**

(i) After the completion of Media Management Initialization [[RMap-MMInit]](#RMap-MMInit), an official channel [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh) of LaC announces a discussion thread for arguments in favor of a particular blockchain network for the LaC Token.  
(ii) After some time (max 30 days), a vote is announced. All users who have obtained SINHRO by that moment can participate by sending a message in NiXeL to user **AlikX** indicating the preferred blockchain network and desired LaC Token name. The top 3 networks by the total SINHRO of voters are announced via official channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh) of LaC.

(iii) The TM [[TM]](#TM) selects from these three the one most technically suitable for implementing the Purple Book of LaC. TM then appoints one experienced blockchain representative to carry out the subsequent steps leading up to allocation of tokens into LaC Reserve Wallets under the supervision of TM and iol authors.

&nbsp;  

 &emsp; **LaC Token Launch:**

As LaC develops and DAO requirements become clearer, DDN [[DDN]](#DDN) and iol authors [[iol]](#iol) are creating an advanced blockchain with record-breaking transaction speeds using quantum cryptography — a **Permissionless Distributed Database Management System**. Later, LaC will be integrated with its native coin within that network.

(iv) To support its future use in native protocols or network, the LaC Token is allocated 53 bits: 33 bits for the integer part and 20 bits for the decimal (up to 6 digits). This caps the total supply at 2³³ = **8,589,934,592** LaC Tokens.

(v) Exactly **8,589,934,592 LaC Tokens** are minted in the chosen network under the selected name, with no possibility of issuing more. The token uses up to 6 decimal places. Depending on the network, issuance may be done directly into Reserve Wallet \#0.

(vi) An official announcement is made via LaC's [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh) channels about the LaC Token launch.

(vii) **Only 50%** (i.e. **4,294,967,296 tokens**) of the LaC Token supply will be available on the crypto market. The remaining 50% is allocated to Reserve Wallet "#0 Insurance" [[Instr-RWInsur]](#Instr-RWInsur).

&nbsp;  

 &emsp; **Selection of Reserve Wallet signatory accounts:**

This section is related to the security of LaC Tokens in Reserve Wallets [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet), their intended use, and therefore it is necessary to select accounts of responsible signatories for transactions of these wallets before the creation of these wallets, and then develop a mechanism for replacing a signatory/wallet in case of inactivity of one of the signatories of a particular wallet.

(viii) An announcement is made in the official LaC channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh) about the collection of addresses/accounts of Reserve Wallet signatories.

(vix) A short instruction is provided for applicants, the execution of which allows determining the level of security/responsibility in managing their blockchain account and their attitude toward a particular type of intellectual resource.

&nbsp;  

&emsp; **Creation of Reserve Wallets:**

(x) LaC Tokens, after generation, are allocated to the Reserve Wallets [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet) with corresponding purposes and regulations:

 &emsp;&emsp; **#0. Insurance**. 50%. 4,294,967,296 tokens. Regulation in [[Instr-RWInsur]](#Instr-RWInsur).

 &emsp;&emsp; **#1. Media management**. 2%. 171,798,692 tokens. Regulation in [[Instr-RWMM]](#Instr-RWMM).

 &emsp;&emsp; **#2. Technical management**. 2%. 171,798,692 tokens. Regulation in [[Instr-RWTM]](#Instr-RWTM).

 &emsp;&emsp; **#3. Security & Charity**. 2%. 171,798,692 tokens. Regulation in [[Instr-RWSec]](#Instr-RWSec).

 &emsp;&emsp; **#4. Financial management**. 2%. 171,798,692 tokens. Regulation in [[Instr-RWFM]](#Instr-RWFM).

 &emsp;&emsp; **#5. Government / Power**. 2%. 171,798,692 tokens. Regulation in [[Instr-RWGov]](#Instr-RWGov).

 &emsp;&emsp; **#6. Accelerator Labor as Capital DAO**. 40%. 3,435,973,836 tokens. Regulation in [[Instr-RWInvest]](#Instr-RWInvest).

(xi) All Reserve Wallets have their own purpose, 5 signatories with 3 required signatures for transactions, and their own special private group chat in iol, accessible via NiXeL [[nxl]](#nxl) — Wallet Chats.

(xii) After the creation of each Reserve Wallet and its initial funding, an announcement is made in the official LaC channel in NiXeL with its technical details, by which their transactions can be tracked in blockchain scan services of the LaC Token network.

(xiii) Reserve Wallet \#0 for Insurance is created according to [[Instr-RWInsur]](#Instr-RWInsur), and all 8,589,934,592 tokens are transferred to the account of this wallet. Distribution to other Reserve Wallets is carried out only from this wallet.

*In accordance with the condition for the completion of MM initialization [[RMap-MMInit]](#RMap-MMInit), by the time of this process there are sufficient intellectual resources to create and fund at least Reserve wallets \#1, \#2. The others are created as a sufficient number of signatories for them appear, and their token amounts are transferred accordingly.*

(xiv) Reserve Wallet \#1 is created for MM [[MM]](#MM) needs according to [[Instr-RWMM]](#Instr-RWMM), and ***171,798,692 tokens*** are transferred to this wallet’s account.

(xv) Reserve Wallet \#2 is created for TM [[TM]](#TM) needs according to [[Instr-RWTM]](#Instr-RWTM), and ***171,798,692 tokens*** are transferred to this wallet’s account.

(xvi) Reserve Wallet \#6 is created for LaC activities as an Accelerator of iol-businesses according to [[Instr-RWInvest]](#Instr-RWInvest), and ***3,435,973,836 tokens*** are transferred to this wallet’s account.

(xvii) When ***selecting signatories for Reserve Wallets ##1-5***, the list of applicants is sorted in descending order of SINHRO amount (or LaC Tokens after issuance) and ascending order of the time they added themselves to [https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/footprint.txt](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/footprint.txt). Accounts of information partners [[infop]](#infop) and those who participated in LaC-iol synchronization [[LaC-iol-sync]](#LaC-iol-sync) with their currency resource have priority in selection.

(xviii) In case of loss of contact with one of the Reserve Wallet signatories, or loss of control over their address in the Reserve Wallet by one of the signatories, and in other cases dangerous for the wallets, a reset of this Reserve Wallet is carried out according to [[Instr-RWReset]](#Instr-RWReset).

(xix) Only signatories of these wallets and the chat admin have access to Wallet Chats. The chat admin assists with technical requests of signatories, consults in case of errors and on issues of using blockchain multisig wallets. In these chats, decisions are made regarding transactions from the wallet after discussions of spending objects in community chats and voting on them [[Instr-TVote]](#Instr-TVote). It is not possible to identify the profiles of chat participants in these chats.

(xx) Reserve Wallet tokens cannot participate in any form of voting.

(xxi) In case of insufficient number of signatories at the time of Reserve Wallet creation, new accounts are created for the missing signatories, which are temporarily transferred to TM overseeing the creation and distribution of Reserve Wallets. Subsequently, upon the appearance of candidates for signatories from the relevant categories of LaC Token holders, a reset of the Reserve Wallet is carried out according to [[Instr-RWReset]](#Instr-RWReset).

### Reserve Wallet "#0 Insurance" Rules

 &emsp; <a id="Instr-RWInsur">[Instr-RWInsur]</a>

(i) Reserve Wallet #0 Insurance or **Wallet \#0** is intended for:

- initially holding all LaC Tokens after issuance;

- compensating for token losses in other Reserve Wallets and the iol crypto Pool [[pool]](#pool) due to technical reasons;

- preventing/correcting manipulation of LaC Token prices and votes, and mitigating threats to LaC goals and technical resources.

(ii) Composed of 5 signatories: ***5 members*** of TM [[TM]](#TM).

(iii) Minimum number of signatures required to operate the wallet account: ***3***.

(iv) Transactions from Wallet \#0’s account can only be made to other Reserve Wallet accounts and to iol [[iol]](#iol). This prohibits the withdrawal of tokens from Wallet \#0’s account to the crypto asset market.

(v) The token volume in Wallet \#0 is equal to the combined volume of all other wallets (**Market Wallets**), which ensures insurance of all tokens available on the global crypto asset market. However, the total volume of emergency compensations in each Market Wallet cannot exceed its initial volume. Such losses are unlikely but may occur at the blockchain network level or due to factors such as hacking, access control failures, or loss of contact with signatories. Each such case undergoes a thorough investigation with the involvement of all intellectual resources to identify the causes, assess the possibility of token recovery or blocking, and eliminate the root cause to prevent recurrence.

 &emsp; <a id="Instr-RWReset">[Instr-RWReset]</a>

*{will be added by TM [[TM]](#TM) depending on the capabilities of the selected blockchain network}*

&nbsp;  

### Determining the Initial Price of LaC Token

 &emsp; <a id="Instr-TInitPrice">[Instr-TInitPrice]</a>

(i) All those wishing to exchange their SINHRO received during the LaC-iol synchronization period [[LaC-iol-sync]](#LaC-iol-sync) for LaC Tokens must submit sell offers for SINHRO in the desired quantity and price relative to the LaC Token in the NiXeL [[nxl]](#nxl) application.

(ii) The amount of LaC Tokens from all offers is transferred to the crypto Pool account *{to be added after the creation of reserve wallets}* of iol [[pool]](#pool) from Reserve Wallet "#1 Media Management".

(iii) From the iol crypto Pool account, LaC Tokens are distributed to the crypto pool balances of TM [[TM]](#TM) proportionally to their allocated SINHRO during the LaC-iol synchronization period.

(iv) Now, iol has users offering to exchange SINHRO for LaC Tokens and users holding LaC Tokens. Deals made on these offers within 30 days determine the initial price of the LaC Token relative to SINHRO; exchanges into other currencies during this period determine the initial price of the LaC Token relative to those currencies.

(v) Based on the initial price of the LaC Token, the number of LaC Tokens for those iol users who participated in the LaC-iol synchronization [[LaC-iol-sync]](#LaC-iol-sync) with their currency resources [[CurrRes]](#CurrRes) is calculated. This amount is transferred to the crypto Pool account *{to be added after the creation of reserve wallets}* of iol [[pool]](#pool) from Reserve Wallet "#4 Financial Management" and credited to the pool balances of these users with an annual yield rate of 25% for the period from the transfer of the currency resource until the determination of the initial price of the LaC Token.

&nbsp;  

### Governing Principles for Security

 &emsp; <a id="Instr-g4s">[Instr-g4s]</a>

(i) Follow generally accepted rules for securing your crypto accounts, private keys, seed phrases, and restricting access to applications with your crypto wallets.

(ii) Do not disclose the identities of LaC intellectual resources except to members of the Board of Frontmen [[BoF]](#BoF).  

(iii) Signatories of Reserve wallets [[ResWallet]](#ResWallet) are ***advised not to reveal their identity*** and to immediately report loss of control of their signatory account in the corresponding Reserve wallet chat — the chat admin will take action.

(iv) Report violators and negative information about LaC, including license violations at [https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/LICENSE](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/LICENSE), by email to [report-lac@e-gove.net](mailto:report-lac@e-gove.net).

(v) Report bugs, vulnerabilities, and other issues in LaC technical resources and iol-app by email to [report-iol@e-gove.net](mailto:report-iol@e-gove.net).

(vi) Report counterfeits of technical resources and the LaC Token names in official LaC information channels [[OfInfoCh]](#OfInfoCh).

(vii) Do not panic in cases of sharp rises or drops in the LaC Token price by more than 7% per day. That is, adhere to the **HODL** principle and do not support such price manipulations with your trades at those prices. Always remember that the LaC Token is not a speculative instrument but a predictable decentralized financial instrument, whose price is directly proportional to the number of users of iol-businesses in the Labor as Capital DAO portfolio and does not depend on the profits of these iol-businesses. **Therefore, it is recommended to acquire the LaC Token as early as possible**.
