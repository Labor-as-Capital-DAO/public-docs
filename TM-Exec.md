## Task Execution Log of the Technical Management



**2026-01-23 - 2026-??-??**: Changes in NiXeL app according to increase the number of iol-connect API endpoints available without passing your account identity verification (KYC). Specifically:
1. Payment of bills using IOU of the iol ecosystem.
2. Management of SINHRO, except for exchange into national currencies. The KYC requirement for using national currencies (or their central banks) is not a requirement from iol - it is a requirement of the laws of the countries of those currencies.
3. Private correspondences and reading of support groups for iol apps.
State: Inited.
