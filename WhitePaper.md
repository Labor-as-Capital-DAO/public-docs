### Abstract

Labor as Capital DAO, abbreviated as **LaC DAO**, is the first and only pure DeFi DAO whose asset is human labor across the globe. To acquire these assets, LaC DAO includes in its portfolio companies that are building businesses (iol-businesses) based on software systems for on-demand outcall services, which are fully developed and available in public release.

LaC DAO has its own unique token on blockchain networks, which enables participation in governance through voting. Thus, LaC DAO consists of individuals who hold LaC DAO tokens. Token holders can manage their tokens at their discretion, including exchanging them for fiat currency and other assets, including crypto currencies.

These tokens can also be listed on stocks, exchanges, and trading platforms, making them a financial instrument that reflects the state of the outcall services market worldwide.

The unique technical and engineering-intellectual resources of LaC DAO include the exclusive commercial representation of the **Internet of Labour** ecosystem/platform and a partnership with **Distributed Digital Nomads** — developers of iol-apps: applications built on the Internet of Labour platform.

The more iol-businesses are included in the LaC DAO portfolio and the more users they have, the higher the value of the LaC DAO token. At the same time, the token's value does not depend on the profitability of the companies in the portfolio.

### 1. Introduction

The creation of **LaC DAO** is the result of work by thousands of specialists in finance, IT, and academia over more than ten years. During these years, many technologies were developed and tested, demonstrating their reliability and becoming an integral part of the operations of companies, individuals, and even government services. LaC DAO is built upon these technologies, using them as tools, and in some cases gaining exclusive access to them — making such technologies unique resources available only to LaC DAO. These privileges provide true stability for its tokens and ensure their reliable value growth over time, as long as there is a market and demand for private on-demand outcall services.

The current global economic situation and demographic crisis are forcing companies and governments to optimize production and business processes, which often leads to increased unemployment and, at the same time, a shortage of manual laborers. This situation fuels high demand for private service providers across various sectors, while simultaneously increasing the number of people compelled to offer their honest services directly, squeezing intermediaries out of the private outcall services market. Commercial IT solutions for matching service providers with clients are emerging. However, the decline in consumer purchasing power renders these startups unprofitable due to insufficient opportunities for monetization to cover the costs of development, technical maintenance, operations, and marketing. As a result, such startups are unattractive to investors.

Another positive sign of the timeliness of LaC DAO's launch is the decline and fading relevance of the **Venture Capital (VC)** institution. The global community has exposed practices bordering on fraud. After numerous social media posts by startup founders who received "support" from VCs — including their stories and even published books — many realized that VC activity is a mix of lottery schemes, data and fund collection mechanisms, idea theft, extraction of sensitive commercial information, falsified metrics for investors, legal hijacking of startups for complete control, misuse of investor funds, threats and coercion of startup founders, and the loss of intellectual, authorial, and related rights to products created by the startup's co-founders, along with control of the company itself.

Their experience with VCs can be summed up in one sentence:  
***"A deal with a VC turns startup founders into slaves of their own company, eventually killing their motivation and forcing them either to abandon it or seek any way out, like a mouse caught in a trap."***

This is understandable, given that the 5% of “successful” startups must cover the losses of the 95% of failed projects in a VC's portfolio. The risks of working with VCs are drastically increasing due to the global political climate and VC demands that startups be registered in specific jurisdictions — which in turn leads to critical levels of dependence and limitations for founders.

Therefore, anyone capable of building a profitable startup with the correct internal structure will not accept any VC terms. These conditions simply do not match today's realities, and a return to the heyday of Venture Capital is unlikely in the coming decades.

LaC DAO firmly stands for human rights.  We often hear expressions like ***“people as capital”*** or ***“he’s the shine on my Ferrari”*** when referring to a truly talented employee. Such phrases are spoken or written by some company owners, government officials, and recruiters. A real human being is free and cannot be the capital of another person, company, or country. This violates human rights, contradicts religious principles, and deeply offends people everywhere. What can be capital is the result of a person’s labor. Initially, labor is the capital of the individual who performs it — only later can this labor (or its result) be voluntarily transferred to a client or employer.

All of this creates ideal conditions for the long-term and successful DeFi operations of LaC DAO, positively impacting the economies of countries where iol-businesses are launched.

LaC DAO is a pure Decentralized Finance [[1]](#1) and Decentralized Autonomous Organization [[2]](#2), whose resources include real Web3 [[3]](#3) systems and highly skilled professionals distributed around the world. Alongside its exclusive resources, LaC DAO maintains a solid and transparent organizational structure and a clear governance plan aimed at consistently achieving its objectives.

This White Paper outlines the key aspects of LaC DAO, offering an initial understanding of the organization's goals, resources, governance, and token potential. Changes to the White Paper are not expected, except in rare cases where updates may be necessary — for example, when web addresses change or corrections need to be made. Any changes are logged in well-known public repositories.

***The name of the LaC DAO blockchain token is not included in this White Paper! The token issuance process, name selection, and distribution are mentioned in the "Organization" section and described in detail in the Purple Book of LaC DAO*** [[4]](#4).

Comprehensive information about LaC DAO's activities, regulations, and roadmap with instructions can be found in its Purple Book [[4]](#4).

### 2. Goals

We will use the word "Value" in relation to the Labor as Capital DAO token, and not the word "Price", because in economics, "price" includes acquisition costs, depends on value, and must be expressed in a specific currency as a unit of measure. Therefore, what matters to us is the value of the token, which allows token holders to personally determine the token's price at the moment they sell their tokens for currency or in relation to any other instruments in the DeFi world in the case of an exchange — for example, Hashcash/Bitcoin [[5]](#5) or crypto coins from other blockchain networks [[6]](#6). This approach reflects LaC DAO's adherence to the principles of a global free market.

So, ***the main and constant goal of Labor as Capital DAO is the progressive growth of its token’s value***. Progressiveness can be equated with predictability even under free market conditions.

#### Calculation of LaC DAO token value

In economics, there are formulas for assessing labor/work, such as labor productivity. But we will use mathematical formulas from physics for several reasons. First, in the service market, a product is not always produced. Second, we are calculating not the cost of labor, but the value of the token, which depends on labor. Third, mathematical formulas are fundamental, which contributes to the progressive nature of the token's value. Fourth, physics has formulas for work, energy, and power, and ***human*** work is indeed a process of labor production in which a person expends ***energy and time***.

There is a formula for power [[7]](#7):

$$
P = \frac{W}{t} 
$$

where $P$ is power, $W$ is work or energy, and $t$ is a unit/interval of time.

This formula is suitable for us because:

(i) it takes into account work, which in the context of labor can be considered human energy spent on producing labor while providing services;

(ii) the value of an object performing work is directly proportional to its power.

This formula means that Power is the amount of work (or energy expended for work) per unit of time.

Applied to a company that builds a business on on-demand outcall service applications, this formula can be interpreted as follows: the Power of the company equals the volume of services (work) that the app users can provide within the territory (region or country) of that business per unit/interval of time $t$:

$$
P_{C}= \frac{ \sum\limits_{n=1}^{N_{U}} W_{n}}t
$$

where $P_C$ is the company’s power,  $N_U$ is the number of users within the company's business territory,  $W_n$ is the volume of services (work) performed by user $n$.

It is obvious that the company’s power directly depends on the number of users of its application in the business territory, and the company’s value is directly proportional to its power.  Then, the formula for the value of the LaC DAO token simplifies to the following form:

$$
V_{T} = \sum\limits_{m=1}^{N_{C}} N_{Um}
$$

where $V_T$ is the value of the LaC DAO token,  $N_C$ is the number of companies in the LaC DAO portfolio,  $N_{Um}$ is the number of users of the application providing services within the business territory of the company with index $m$.

This formula means that the more companies LaC DAO includes in its portfolio that build businesses on on-demand outcall service applications, and the more users these applications have providing services in those companies’ territories, the higher the value of the LaC DAO token.  From this, two more goals of LaC DAO arise:

***(i) to acquire as many companies as possible into the LaC DAO portfolio that build businesses on on-demand outcall service applications;***

***(ii) to assist these companies in attracting as many users as possible, i.e., to act as an Accelerator.***

Strategies and detailed instructions for these goals are provided in the Purple Book [[4]](#4).

As we can see from the formula, the profitability of the companies in the LaC DAO portfolio does not affect the token's valuation. These companies can be registered in any countries where their applications can operate. They must run their business in accordance with the laws of their respective countries, but their responsibility in no way extends to LaC DAO, i.e., to the token holders. Moreover, a company being part of the LaC DAO portfolio does not impact its shareholders and founders — on the contrary, it helps them promote their business while remaining independent from LaC DAO, provided they comply with the simple conditions for inclusion in the LaC portfolio. **Labor as Capital DAO is the best Accelerator** for companies building B2B2C IT businesses for private on-demand outcall services!

However, LaC DAO token holders are interested in the free conversion of their tokens into national currencies and other assets, including crypto currencies. Therefore, LaC DAO pursues another goal: ***to list the LaC DAO token on various crypto exchanges/stocks***, where the token valuation will be used to guide pricing.

#### Forecast of the token’s market price

As we can see from the formula for the value of the LaC DAO token, it has no unit of measure; it is simply a number that increases as new companies are added to the portfolio and begin operating. After the token is issued and distributed, an initial token price $P_0$ will be calculated. It will be determined in several popular units of measure, both fiat and crypto, which can be used for cross-rates.  By applying this initial price $P_0$ with the value number $V_T$ through a linear function $f$, which is directly proportional to the token’s value, we obtain a projected trading chart of the LaC DAO token across different platforms in their respective currencies/units:

$$
P = f(P_0 , V_T, I_M)
$$

![Chart 1](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/imgs/chart_tokenPrice.png?raw=true "Chart 1") 

This projected chart also reflects ***the progressive growth of the LaC DAO token’s price*** on trading platforms, taking into account the influence of the free market ($I_M$) in the form of supply-demand, as well as the flow of information about LaC DAO and its token in the media. By "media," we mean any information sources, including our own news channels, open or closed messenger groups, blogger platforms, website posts, and so on.

The chart begins from the moment $P_0$ is calculated. Throughout the entire chart, similar fluctuations and segments repeat, such as those in the **Period A** interval. These segments are meaningful and reflect the stages of organization and governance. For detailed calculations, instructions, and timelines, refer to the Purple Book [[4]](#4).

A portion of Period A will be shown in **Chart 2** and examined in detail below in the sections "Organization" and "Governance." Those sections will also address the importance of avoiding scam manipulations like "Pump and Dump" and others.

Thus, the ***progressive growth*** of the token price $P$ means that for any time $t_X$, there exists a $t_Y > t_X$ where $ P(t_Y) \geq P(t_X)$. This is the mathematical definition of **the main and ongoing goal of Labor as Capital DAO**.

### 3. Resources and Capabilities

In this section, we will examine in detail the resources and capabilities for the long-term operation of LaC DAO and the high likelihood of achieving all its goals.

#### Unique and exclusive ecosystem/platform

The launch of Labor as Capital DAO becomes possible because LaC DAO has received the exclusive right to represent the **"Internet of Labour" ecosystem/platform**, briefly **iol** [[8]](#8).

![iol](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/9450bcd566ec7a63c646fc069568770022f20118/imgs/nixel-iol2lac-anounce.jpg?raw=true "iol - LaC")

This is announced on the main official news channel of the ecosystem in the “FAQ & Support” section from a special service account of the special NiXeL [[9]](#9) application of the Internet of Labour (iol) ecosystem. Some parts of the ecosystem, such as iol-apps, were made publicly available in September 2024. ***A detailed explanation of how it works is provided in a video at link*** [[8]](#8).

The beginning of the **Internet of Labour (iol)** project was laid in 2010 in Turkey and began implementation with a letter to IMMI Australia in 2012. In Australia, research into labor in the global economy continued along with technical experiments in LabourTime applications [[10]](#10).

#### Engineering and intellectual resource

A group of highly qualified IT specialists with many years of experience began using the name **Distributed Digital Nomads (DDN)** during the COVID-19 lockdown, when many professionals were stuck in different countries or started working from home. After the lockdown, they continued using this name without registering a single primary company due to the global crisis, geopolitical conflicts, unpredictable government regulations, and restrictions. DDN is a virtual private unstructured entity that was the first to specialize in developing apps for on-demand outcall services on the Internet of Labour platform, i.e., iol-apps [[11]](#11). Later, other types of specialists joined DDN and now cooperate within the iol ecosystem remotely.

***Specific terms and definitions used in the Internet of Labour ecosystem are described in detail in the Terms and Conditions of Use of the NiXeL App*** [[12]](#12).

Distributed Digital Nomads, who participate in the development and improvement of iol, are the authors of iol. Most authors also prefer not to reveal their identities on NiXeL and DDN pages or use pseudonyms. The reasons for this may include employment at well-known corporations, government institutions, or visa conditions in the countries they reside in. This, just like the anonymity of token holders, is beneficial for the security of the global LaC DAO.

#### Third-party technical resources

In addition to its own exclusive resources, LaC DAO makes use of numerous technologies developed by many specialists. DDN specialists may also have participated in some of them, including open source projects. These technologies and methodologies have demonstrated high reliability over many years and have been adopted worldwide, both by commercial companies and government institutions.

Bitcoin initiated blockchain networks and is now a recognized tool and asset used by the world’s largest financial institutions. Other blockchain networks continued the revolution in decentralized finance and have become powerful instruments for global financial operations. At the same time, the reliability of decentralized asset storage proves the resilience of this approach in the face of global economic crises and geopolitical conflicts.

This leads to the development of Web3. Web3 generally refers to decentralized/distributed internet systems, and such systems may use a combination of different internet system architectures, including blockchain networks.

The global Internet of Labour ecosystem is part of Web3 and is designed to promote employment and contribute to reducing crime.

#### Own Token

As part of organizing LaC DAO, at a certain point following several other foundational steps — such as selecting the blockchain network and naming the token — the native LaC DAO token is issued in accordance with the detailed procedures and instructions outlined in the Purple Book. The token is anonymous and carries no restrictions for its holders based on characteristics such as gender, nationality, citizenship, religion, etc.

The token serves multiple purposes:

(i) It is used for voting on matters related to the governance and development of LaC DAO. Important updates or additions to the functionality of The Internet of Labour may also be subject to token-holder voting.

(ii) It can be freely exchanged by holders for anything of value — fiat and crypto currencies, tangible and intangible assets, real estate, services — on any platform that supports such exchanges.

(iii) It is used as a means for including iol-businesses in the LaC DAO portfolio. This is treated as an investment in an iol-business and should be used by these businesses to attract users within the regions they operate. The procedure for iol-businesses to apply for inclusion in LaC DAO is detailed in the Purple Book.

***A Decentralized Autonomous Organization cannot be shut down or halted after the issuance of its governance token — DAO continues to exist as long as the token is being used by at least two holders.***

The token's free convertibility, LaC DAO’s decentralized investment operations, and its influence on the functionality of the Web3 platform The Internet of Labour make it a **DeFi** project. Additionally, the ability of token holders to invest in the growth of iol-businesses across various countries and regions positions it as an **International Accelerator**.

#### Media and Other Information Resources

***An excellent opportunity for public figures, owners of popular information platforms, and well-known bloggers.***

By "media", we refer to any sources of information, including private or public news channels of LaC DAO, messenger groups (open or closed), bloggers' channels, website posts, etc. However, in the context of resources, we do not treat them as technical carriers or communication channels. 
To fulfill its function as an Accelerator, LaC DAO is building an extensive network of independent partners who influence the mass audiences of various media resources and channels. These partners, along with the engineering and intellectual resource, participate in the distribution of tokens immediately after the launch of LaC DAO tokens and control a significant portion of them.

Media partners have a ***special ability*** to directly influence LaC DAO’s Accelerator function. For this reason, LaC DAO governance provides them with an optional status with special rights as members of the **Board of Frontmen (BoF)**. This gives them access to information from the authors of the Internet of Labour (iol) ecosystem/platform, which is not yet available to anyone except the authors themselves, including upcoming plans.  
This way, each of these media partners independently decides whether to publish information before it becomes publicly available and impacts the token’s price. Additionally, Board of Frontmen members who have entered the authors’ information space may have two accounts in the iol ecosystem — one for public activity and one for private, similar to the iol authors, as they are authors of informational materials.  
All privileges of Board of Frontmen members are detailed in the Purple Book of LaC DAO.

#### Currency Resource

Currency resources include fiat currencies of all countries and the top 20 crypto currencies by daily trading volume on popular crypto stock exchanges.  
Anyone using currency resources in relation to the LaC token is directly participating in financial governance, which represents the **DeFi** implementation of LaC DAO.  
Likewise, through the LaC DAO token, iol-businesses receive this resource if it is required for the purposes stated in their application to the LaC DAO portfolio.

#### iol-providers

The breadth and flexibility of the technical implementation of the Internet of Labour ecosystem make it a true platform — enabling individuals or companies to create and launch fully functional mobile applications for booking on-site services (**iol-apps**) within days. These individuals or entities are the owners of their iol-apps and are referred to as "iol-providers". 
An iol-provider does not need to worry about server development or maintenance. Occasional seasonal updates and support can be handled by a remote technical partner on a contract basis. The DDN group can also help connect iol-providers with experienced specialists when needed.

This means the iol-provider can launch their product into the hands of entrepreneurs and build a business based on their iol-app. The iol-business can take any territorial scale and model at the discretion of the iol-provider, ***according to the legislation of their local region — whether a franchise, SaaS, a network of branches, etc***.

The Internet of Labour (iol) was originally designed as a global, non-profit, non-institutional social project. iol strictly maintains a balance between open source, openness, security, authorship, and fundamental human rights. It offers iol-providers as much functionality as possible, which should be used in compliance with the laws of the iol-business’s region.

LaC DAO inherits the foundational values of the authors of The Internet of Labour ecosystem/platform and upholds its core principles:

(i) The right to labor and creativity. 

(ii) The right to move through space and time. 

(iii) The right to express one’s thoughts — speech. 

(iv) The right to a private life and the privacy of personal relationships between two individuals.

(v) The right to manage personal property.

(vi) The right to manage one’s time.

(vii) The right to social engagement and status, as long as they do not contradict the other principles on this list.

(viii) The right to parenthood.

(ix) The right to defend the rights listed above.

These inherited principles do not limit LaC DAO token holders, but they do oblige them not to violate these rights.

The authors of iol are the most invested in its growth and reliability. They continue to develop iol academically and independently, regardless of their location, in a decentralized architecture. They are unconcerned with popularity, profit, vanity, or fame. They focus on perfection, applying their experience and the latest technological trends to deliver iol functionality to iol-providers. At the same time, they are also the first and regular users of the iol-apps.

Meanwhile, iol-businesses can operate as for-profit ventures, with extremely low operating costs allowing for high profitability while charging very low commissions to their app users. In fact, municipal or governmental bodies aiming to support local employment can launch their own iol-apps with zero commissions. In contrast, companies outside the iol ecosystem offering on-site service apps cannot match these low fees — not even enough to cover their basic operating costs.

***This exclusive representation of the Internet of Labour ecosystem/platform by Labor as Capital DAO makes the LaC DAO token truly unique in the global DeFi and blockchain space.***

Flexibility, well-structured organization and governance of LaC DAO make its token demonstrates a consistently upward growth trend with high probability, independent of the individual profitability of iol-businesses.

### 4. Organization

Labor as Capital DAO, by definition, is not a legal entity of any political, territorial, or social formation such as a country/state/monarchy or their unions. LaC DAO is not the property of any other organization or private individual, and it does not bear collective responsibility for the holders of the LaC DAO token, just as no LaC DAO token holder bears any responsibility for LaC DAO.

The launch of the supranational organization Labor as Capital DAO and its governance is carried out in accordance with its ***Purple Book — the main public document of the DAO***.

#### Purple Book

The Purple Book has a special structure to optimize the exchange of information through writing, considering time and internet capabilities.

The Purple Book is dynamic, i.e., it is a file available on a git resource along with all public documents/files of LaC DAO, where changes can be proposed as the DAO develops: everyone can see the authors, time, and content of changes. The Purple Book contains provisions, instructions, rules, conditions, a log of important events, voting results, plans, and explanations. It functions as a charter, a founding agreement, and a logbook of the "ship named Labor as Capital in the ocean of the internet" — all in one file. This dynamic nature of the Purple Book allows, for example, instructions to be written in advance before the dates of events are known in other parts of the Purple Book that those instructions depend on. Or to replace external links when they become outdated, thus maintaining a high degree of decentralization of Labor as Capital DAO.

***Before reviewing the Purple Book, it is recommended to carefully study the White Paper of Labor as Capital DAO.***

The White Paper contains the rationale for the plans and actions described in the Purple Book and other documents. Also, the original Purple Book always contains up-to-date links to secondary information resources of LaC DAO and community chats in different languages.

#### Why DAO?

In recent history, international non-profit or political organizations — such as humanitarian, scientific research, or environmental groups — have predominantly been registered in Switzerland. Meanwhile, international corporations, trade organizations, and tech companies have typically chosen the United States for registering their headquarters. There are also many international organizations registered in countries like Singapore, the United Kingdom, the UAE, and in various special economic zones around the world. Many blockchain-related companies also choose to register in specific countries. For example, the Ethereum Foundation is registered in Switzerland as a non-profit organization — and since then, the Ethereum community has not demonstrated significant technological breakthroughs in the crypto, DeFi, or DAO space.

However, the structure of any such company depends on its country of registration and is regulated by the laws of that country, based on its ownership form, the composition of co-owners, and shareholders. 
Since September 2024, various ownership structures and conditions in different countries and economic zones were explored for Labor as Capital. Political dynamics around the world, shifting government decisions, and military conflicts were observed. Special attention was given to a public post by the Distributed Digital Nomads [[13]](#13). 
During this time, we identified significant downsides to registering Labor as Capital as a company/organization in any country or political-territorial formation, including:

- growing proportion of non-working-age populations;

- emergence of trade, political, and active military conflicts with long-lasting consequences;

- tightening regulations for organizations with foreign participation;

- stricter conditions for business travel and visas;

- unclear or hostile attitudes of governments toward crypto and DeFi;

- absence or unreliability of crypto asset and exchange regulations;

- discrimination based on race, nationality, or religion in some regions;

- excessive bureaucracy that hinders organizational goals;

- state or corporate monopolies and censorship of truthful information;

- altered information in major corporate services due to various pressures, including from governments;

- corruption and self-interest among top-level managers of public and corporate institutions;

- asset seizures and forced bankruptcies;

- movement restrictions due to epidemics or wars;

- migration and forced change of motherland or permanent residence.

The value of the LaC DAO blockchain token is indifferent to nations or states, meaning they have no need or incentive to interfere in its governance. On the level of employment, however, their populations may benefit from hourly jobs via iol-businesses — or even launch their own commission-free iol-apps.

For all these reasons, and considering the mission of Labor as Capital's core resource — the Internet of Labour ecosystem/platform — the chosen organizational form is a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**. This significantly increases the probability of achieving the goals of LaC DAO while multiplying the value for its token holders without compromising their security.

The use of a blockchain token and git-based documents [[14]](#14) for DAO governance ensures true international democracy and transparency for all token holders — with the highest possible level of decentralization and minimal reliance on third-party services.

#### Why GitHub?

At the time of LaC DAO's launch, the popular public **git** service **GitHub** was chosen for hosting the organization's website and documentation. Git meets the requirements of true decentralization for LaC DAO:

- open source, with the ability to run git services accessible via the internet or limited to a local network;

- users can create copies (clones) of repositories on other servers or local machines, thereby ensuring decentralized storage of LaC DAO documents;

- files can be placed in public repositories accessible to all, or in repositories with restricted access;

- account holders are not required to provide identity verification;

- it supports a role system, and administrators can be multiple, both at the server and repository level;

- users can propose file content changes, and everyone can view the full history of modifications.

Git itself is not dependent on the GitHub service. GitHub uses git and offers additional functionality such as notifications about changes, a mobile app with push notifications, the ability to follow companies and repositories, collaborative tools, etc. At the same time, GitHub does not increase LaC DAO's dependency, because the repositories can be migrated at any time to other public git services or to dedicated LaC DAO nodes, using local clones for full restoration.

Moreover, ***git is an integral part of the Open Source, Crypto, and DeFi world***. The source code of nearly all blockchain technologies and crypto wallet applications is available through public git services like GitHub in partially or fully open repositories. The same approach is followed by the Internet of Labour ecosystem/platform and its iol-providers.

#### Launch of LaC DAO

After the publication of all public documents in the LaC DAO repository, the launch phases of LaC DAO begin in accordance with the Purple Book:

- Attracting information partners — media resources.

- Forming the Board of Frontmen from among willing media and engineering resources.

- Selecting the blockchain network, the name, and issuing the LaC DAO token.

- Distributing the token between special reserve multisig wallets and all individuals who positively contributed to organizing LaC DAO.

- Determining the initial token rate in USD, Bitcoin, and SINHRO [[8]](#8) by the token holders.

- Testing the LaC DAO token-based voting system. This will also fine-tune the mechanism for proposing and implementing changes and additions to the Internet of Labour ecosystem/platform by token holders.

During the organization phase of LaC DAO, significant refinement and improvement of the Purple Book can be expected from active participants in the founding process, in line with their competencies in the relevant fields. Subsequently, sections of the Purple Book may be modernized as new token holders join and as the blockchain, DeFi, DAO, and Web3 fields evolve.

***The synergy resulting from the synchronization of independent resources used in Labor as Capital DAO has given rise to a unique Decentralized Autonomous Organization with the first and only blockchain token backed by human labor and creative energy. At the same time, this token belongs to these intellectual resources.***

Now, the first exchanges and transactions of the Labor as Capital DAO token can take place, marking the beginning of **Chart 1**, presented in the "Goals" section.

![Chart 1](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/imgs/chart_tokenPrice.png?raw=true "Chart 1") 

By applying decentralized governance using the token and LaC DAO’s technical resources, this emerging **synergy** can be harnessed to achieve the goals of LaC DAO — ***consistent growth in the token's price***.

It is important to note that, due to the aging population, the next 20–30 years will see a decrease in the supply of services and an increase in demand for services, which will also lead to a rise in both the value of labor and the demand for services in iol-apps.

### 5. Governance

Aside from the legacy Electronic Governance Network (e-gove NET), there are several third-party services specifically designed for registering DAOs and performing DAO-related governance functions. However, LaC DAO minimizes its dependency on third-party services — including domain names — and relies on its own engineering and technical resources to operate in alignment with the needs of LaC DAO token holders. Its goals, conditions, and resources make LaC DAO as decentralized as possible. 
However, decentralization must not be used against the organization’s goals, the independence of its resources, or the rights of its token holders. To achieve this, it is important to maintain a balance between "low DAO" and "high DAO" by reasonably distributing governance mechanisms across LaC DAO’s technical resource layers: L1 (Layer 1), L2, and L3. This approach also helps save time and reduce transaction costs on the blockchain. For example, in iol, the integration of L1 with L3 uses an internal Pool accessible to DApps such as the iol-app NiXeL.
Similarly, the commonly held belief that a DAO with a governance token must rely solely on the token’s smart contract is not entirely accurate. Blockchain smart contracts are still in early development stages and are not yet capable of reliably encompassing all governance processes of serious DAOs like Labor as Capital within the token’s contract.
To support this claim, one can cite incidents like the Ethereum Classic hack and vulnerabilities in Solana. But experience in combining L1, L2, and L3 over time — alongside the evolution of LaC and blockchain — will eventually lead to more stable decentralized governance and data storage technologies.

Labor as Capital, as a DAO, does not have a vertical structure like companies do. However, LaC DAO is dual-tiered because it has token holders who also hold the privilege of being members of the Board of Frontmen (BoF) and signers of LaC DAO’s reserve wallets. This is necessary for the organization's function as an business **Accelerator**, resource connector, and insurance mechanism. 
All actions within LaC DAO are performed voluntarily by token holders, just as BoF membership is voluntary — everyone is united by the common mission of the organization, and initiatives are carried out regardless of their primary workplace. Token holders of LaC DAO can declare themselves BoF members if they act publicly on the internet in the interests of LaC DAO and have a verified account within iol. As a result, all BoF members know and interact with one another without any central management structure. They are recognized by DDN and special iol accounts, which grants them access to private channels within LaC DAO’s technical and intellectual resources. 
General rules and instructions for BoF members are maintained in the Purple Book.

LaC DAO's governance consists of the following continuously active processes, in which token holders or their representatives participate:

- **Mass public awareness of LaC DAO, its token, and its events.** This includes posts, blogs, videos, participation in conferences, podcasts — i.e., any information channels and platforms. Information is spread about new iol-businesses added to the LaC DAO portfolio. Their statistics and positive news are regularly published in media outlets.

- **Updating the Purple Book.** This involves making changes and additions to instructions, rules, procedures, links, secondary information channels, etc., in the Purple Book. It also includes integrating new tools into the governance process.

- **Listing the LaC DAO token on crypto stock exchanges and DEXs.** Anyone or any group can do this, but token holders of LaC DAO are the most interested in doing so. News about such actions is published through official channels and by interested media partners.

- **Admission of new iol-businesses into the LaC DAO portfolio.** LaC DAO does not invest in or sponsor ideas, projects, etc. Instead, it provides resources to iol-businesses that are building or growing their business using fully functioning, publicly released iol-apps, in accordance with the procedures in the Purple Book. These resources are provided to attract users — which directly supports LaC’s primary goal and simultaneously fulfills its function as an Accelerator of Systems for Outcall Services. This does not limit LaC DAO token holders from helping iol-businesses in other ways or from owning their own iol-business.

- **Influencing the Internet of Labour ecosystem/platform.** DDN developers take into account the feedback of ordinary end users of iol-apps and iol-providers as much as possible. However, LaC DAO token holders may require specialized functionality that is not available to regular users of iol-apps — for example, tools for LaC DAO governance: easy and free voting; special APIs for statistical data; token trading/exchange. Such proposals can be brought to a vote within LaC DAO and will be considered with special attention by DDN and iol authors. There may also be proposals for critical changes in the iol ecosystem — such as changing the Financial Services Provider (FSP) or migrating the LaC DAO token to another blockchain network. Detailed procedures are in the Purple Book.

- **Identifying opponents of LaC DAO’s goals.** This is a self-evident process since such opponents may lead to losses for token holders and are likely violating the terms of use of iol-apps — in particular, the Terms and Conditions of Use of the NiXeL App [[12]](#12).

All of this governance activity should contribute to approaching the conditional trajectory described in **Chart 1** as closely as possible. 
The most important part of this is the initial period after LaC DAO is launched. In Chart 1, this period is highlighted as **Period A**. Let’s examine it in more detail using **Chart 2**.

![Chart 2](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/9450bcd566ec7a63c646fc069568770022f20118/imgs/chart_tokenPrice_PeriodA.png?raw=true "Chart 2") 

It begins from the moment the first exchange of the LaC DAO token for another currency takes place.  Before this exchange occurs, several steps are completed: the token is issued and distributed; its initial price relative to USD, Bitcoin, and SINHRO is determined by the launch participants of LaC DAO.  These participants are the first and largest holders of the governance token and may be called the *founders* of Labor as Capital DAO.

*Period A* is schematically divided into segments, each with a specific name to help identify the processes and development stages of LaC DAO along with their possible impact on the token price.  For example, the time when two iol-businesses were added to LaC DAO's portfolio is included in Period A, and the expected impact of this on the token price is shown in segments **Period A-2** and **Period A-4**.

Let’s go through each segment in order.

**Period A-1** begins at the price level that was set according to the procedures described in the Purple Book at the end of the LaC DAO organization process or after the LaC-iol synchronization phase. This level reflects a price below which early contributors — token holders who joined LaC DAO before the token issuance — would not want to sell or exchange their LaC DAO tokens. It is expected that during *Period A-1*, this price level will remain relatively stable. During this time, informational activity continues, and the first applications from iol-businesses with fully operational and publicly available iol-apps are received.
Once an iol-business meets the conditions, it is added to the LaC DAO portfolio and receives funding from LaC DAO to promote its business — i.e., to attract users. This marks the beginning of **Period A-2**, which reflects an increase in token sale offers in the market, as outlined in the business plan submitted by the iol-business to the LaC DAO Accelerator. Naturally, an increase in token supply on the market may lead to a price decline. ***Token holders should follow official news and avoid panic during such phases by understanding the reasons behind them!***
After the iol-business receives the necessary funds from the token sale, the money is used to attract users to its service. The resulting increase in users is reflected in LaC DAO statistics and media coverage.  
Since the token price, as defined in prior formulas, is directly proportional to the total number of users across all iol-businesses, this increase leads to a price rise by the end of *Period A-2*, marking the beginning of **Period A-3**.

The first iol-business in the LaC DAO portfolio continues to grow by attracting more and more users. As the popularity of this iol-business rises, so does the visibility of LaC DAO and its token. Bloggers and other media outlets that previously mentioned this iol-business start receiving more traffic due to increased public interest in the brand — simultaneously with the rising price of the LaC DAO token, which some of them hold. This price growth is shown in *Period A-3*. 
By the end of *Period A-3*, a slowdown in the growth rate of users for ther first iol-business may occur.

**Period A-4** resembles *Period A-2* because another iol-business has now joined the LaC DAO portfolio, and some token sales were needed to fund its marketing/promotion expenses. As a result, a new user inflow starts for this second iol-business, at its own pace — this is **Period A-5**.
It is important to understand that the chart reflects the token price, which is dependent on the total number of users across all iol-apps in the LaC DAO portfolio. However, user activity is not factored into the price formula.

**Period A-6** shows a possible — but not mandatory — event. As mentioned in the **Goals** section, LaC DAO embraces market freedom, and listing the LaC DAO token on crypto stock exchanges is one of the aims of Labor as Capital. This means that in addition to the increase in user numbers at iol-businesses, the token price may also be affected by negative news and various *market manipulation attempts*.

There can be different causes and motives for such manipulation attempts. Let’s explore some possible reasons.

**Large buyers.** Suppose the popularity of the iol-apps and the growth potential of LaC DAO catch the attention of a buyer looking to acquire LaC DAO tokens in large volume. They want to buy as many tokens as possible within a fixed budget.

**Speculators.** A speculator with some personal or borrowed funds notices the liquidity of the LaC DAO token and the reliability of its valuation. They aim to make a short-term profit by buying well below the current price and selling once the price quickly rebounds. They may also attempt to stage the opposite pattern seen in *Period A-6* — a so-called “Pump and Dump” — where they buy tokens at the current price, inflate the market with hype, and sell at the artificially high price before it falls back to its justified level according to the LaC DAO token valuation formula.

**Interest Pushers.** These individuals might attempt to accumulate a significant number of tokens to raise a critical issue for voting and then sway the vote in their favor.

**Saboteurs.** These actors may have more dangerous motives, such as trying to slow down or stop the expansion and development of iol-businesses.
They might spread disinformation, carry out hacker attacks on LaC DAO’s technical infrastructure, bribe or interfere with the personal lives of Board of Frontmen members, and so on.
To counter such events and recover from their consequences, several mechanisms are in place — many of which are described in the Purple Book. These include, for example: an *insurance multisig reserve wallet* with a significant supply of tokens; a special management process titled *"Identifying Opponents of LaC DAO Goals"*; the *resource independence* of LaC DAO.
But, the *most reliable protection* against loss in such situations lies with each individual LaC DAO token holder, and it includes:

- ***Carefully reading the official LaC DAO information channels***.

- ***Avoiding panic and emotional trading — HODL!*** The token is safely stored on the blockchain and is not going anywhere. Once the period of disinformation or technical attack stabilizes, you can decide how to handle your token at a fair, predictable price. On-demand outcall services are always in demand, and according to statistics, malicious actors tend to lose in the long run.

The likelihood of price manipulation (as seen in *Period A-6*) is higher when trading volume is low and infrequent on exchanges — when it’s still possible to simulate fake trades between one's own accounts at target prices. ***But if you don’t react to these manipulations, you can continue to sell your tokens based on the valuation formula***.

Therefore, similar segments to those in Period A will appear throughout the Chart 1 timeline, but with overall constant growth as more iol-businesses are added to the LaC DAO portfolio — with possible minor dips during onboarding phases.  
The growth dynamics across different chart segments will vary due to free market forces, the innovative activity of token holders, and the intensity of user acquisition across all iol-businesses within the IASOS Labor as Capital DAO portfolio.

### 6. Conclusion

We have developed a true Decentralized Autonomous Organization — **Labor as Capital (LaC DAO)** — with transparent structure and democratic governance. It is not based on trust or subordination, but rather on **mathematical statistics** of employment in outcall services, **serious technical infrastructure**, and **reputable information channels**.

In this White Paper, we have outlined the following:

#### DeFi

Labor as Capital is an **International Accelerator of Systems for Outcall Services (IASOS)** that invests in the growth and marketing of companies building businesses on fully developed, tested, and publicly released mobile applications for on-demand outcall services. These companies may be located in any country. Investments are made using blockchain networks, DEXs, Web3 resources, and DApps.

#### The Internet of Labour Ecosystem / Platform

LaC DAO has **exclusive access** to the **Internet of Labour (iol)** ecosystem and acts as its official representative. The mobile applications of businesses within the LaC DAO portfolio are built on the Internet of Labour platform and operate within its ecosystem, making them genuine **DApps**. It allows these businesses to operate more profitably and offer better terms for users — advantages that similar businesses outside the Internet of Labour ecosystem cannot offer.

#### With Serious Intentions — and Forever

Outcall services, where real physical work is done, are **always in demand everywhere**.  
iol-apps become a lifeline during mass layoffs caused by AI, economic crises, or other disruptions. Each iol app specializes in a particular service domain, and together, they can cover the entire spectrum of service needs. iol-apps with similar offerings **compete** among themselves, constantly improving user conditions.

Economic crises **benefit** iol-businesses, due to increase demand for gig work and hourly services — it becomes easier to promote iol-apps to the general public.  
In stable economies, higher consumer spending power means **higher service prices** and **greater commission profits**. However, LaC DAO token holders are **not concerned with business profitability** — the **token value is directly proportional** to the **total number of users** across all iol-businesses in the LaC DAO portfolio.

#### The Only Blockchain Token Backed by Human Labor and Energy

The more tokens are purchased — the more iol-businesses enter the LaC DAO portfolio and receive funding for promotion.  
More users of iol-businesses — higher token price.  
More businesses in the portfolio — greater token visibility, and hence higher trading volumes.  
At the same time, this is a **governance token** of LaC DAO, allowing holders to influence its development and infrastructure.

***Thus, the LaC DAO token is a unique financial crypto asset, ideal for:***

- ***Reliable value preservation*** during uncertainty in other investments, unstable fiat exchange rates, potential disruptions during Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) implementations, preparation for the *"Great Reset 2030"*, and unbacked crypto assets;

- ***Steady capital growth*** and ***inflation protection*** thanks to a predictable valuation model;

- ***Pension accumulation*** or ***long-term savings***, due to LaC DAO’s potential to scale to all types of outcall services worldwide;

- ***Governance participation*** in LaC DAO, where 1 token = 1 vote;

- ***Influencing Internet of Labour features***, since LaC DAO voting can affect ecosystem decisions;

- ***Profit generation through trading***, as the LaC DAO token is a blockchain-based asset and can be listed on any crypto stock exchange and DEXs;

- Supporting ***employment in private outcall services*** and ***curbing the growth of street crime***.
