# How to create/add/edit documents localisation

#### (For GitHub users in the browser)


Repository file changes in Git must be made in your fork of the repository!



If the `locals` directory does not contain a folder named after the desired localization language, add a new directory with that name to `locals`.



Open the directory for the desired language.



If there is no file with the name of the original document, create one.



Open the required document.



Click the edit button.



Make changes by providing an exact translation of the original document into the required language.



Click **"Commit changes..."**



(You can modify the "Commit message" and "Extended description" if needed)



Click **"Propose changes..."**



Your changes have now been sent to the original repository, but they haven't appeared in the original document yet. If you wish, you can use various options, such as **"Discuss and review the changes in this comparison with others"** before requesting the changes to be applied to the original file.



Click **"Create pull request."**
