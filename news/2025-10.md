**Bed rots and Quiet quitters are a huge global niche** - a space of "numerous pieces of diamonds and gold lying freely in the dirt" of the post-industrial economy with an aging population.

*One day you will thank this day because this post is about solving the problems of many people around the world during this long global crisis and sharing unique opportunities.*

But this is not an advertisement prompting you to immediate purchase. This is a liberal mobilization, so you should read it carefully and then:

- You will preserve your wealth if you are already a wealthy person.

- You will help the people of your region with emplyment if you are a public figure, and this will strengthen respect for you in your community.

- And if you are an entrepreneur, you will earn a wealth from grateful clients who so badly need this global business of yours.

- You will find a saving position in a regional representation of an existing global business if you yourself are nearly burned out at your job and about to be fired (or already have been). And you will be trained for free by experienced members of the "Internet of Labour" community.

- Maybe youâ€™ve long dreamed of your own IT startup? You will get your own fully operational application, like Uber but for outcall services, without needing to search for and hire programmers. You will own the source code and produstion release available on Google app store under your account. There is even an accelerator for your startup with targeted investment in the startup.

- Perhaps you are a popular blogger, but maybe with falling interest in your information resource. You will find a new, unique topic here and a long-term partnership with a transparent monetization scheme.

- If you are a crypto DeFi investor, you have access to the first and only RWA token backed by real human labor.

- And if you are a globally-minded strategist with a firm desire to influence the management of a global organization, you will most likely find the key to the most secret rooms of such an organization here.

So, this is about humanity's and the economy's most important and fundamental resources: people's energy and time. More precisely, the optimization of human labor and the newest available tools for this.

The trigger for this post was the recent article, "Bed Rot: The Final Stage of Burnout?" from the architect of the non-commercial opensource distributed/Web3 ecosystem/platform The Internet of Labour.
