**The ALLADIN's algorithm by BlackRock didn’t just predict market prices - it shaped them**, turning the stock market into a controllable system. ***Get ready for a powerful shake-up - and a chance to profit from it***.

Remember ***Larry Fink***'s career story and how he made billions during the 2000s crisis using the **Alladin** system, developed by a brilliant team of mathematicians and programmers including ***Susan Wagner*** and ***Ben Golub***? That system generated massive profits in a short time not only for **BlackRock** but also for every Wall Street ape who recognized Alladin’s potential early. Meanwhile, the conservative traders who laughed at it lost big during the dot-com crash.

Alladin 3.0 is the codename of an initial airdrop event from **Labor as Capital DAO** (**LaC DAO**) in the **iol–LaC synchronization period**. The governance tokens of Labor as Capital DAO are the world’s first and only RWA (Real World Asset) tokens backed by human labor. Labor as Capital DAO is a true DeFi accelerator with a fully realized **Internet of Labour** (**iol**) ecosystem and platform. Developed over several years by experienced applied mathematicians and supported by advanced developers, **iol** represents a breakthrough in decentralized labor economics.

You can find detailed information about Labor as Capital DAO, **iol**, and its predictable RWA token exchange model in the publicly available **Purple Book** and **White Paper** on the GitHub: [https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/WhitePaper.md](https://github.com/Labor-as-Capital-DAO/public-docs/blob/main/WhitePaper.md)

Now, about that **powerful shake-up**. It will be a surge of unique RWA tokens dropping ***directly into your crypto wallets and iol pool balances***. You’ll be the ones trading them, building wealth for yourselves. At the same time it advances the nonprofit social oriented **Internet of Labour ecosystem** - designed to solve real problems of employment and service accessibility for millions during this ongoing global crisis...

Stay tuned to the official channels of Labor as Capital DAO and don’t miss the "Alladin 3.0 airdrop" during the **iol-LaC synchronization** period.

The formation of the LaC DAO governing community is also underway with special terms for crypto bloggers/influencers - take your place on board!
